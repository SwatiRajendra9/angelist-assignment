# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# angelist-assignment



Hey team, 

Thanks for giving this opportunity. I had a lot of fun doing the project.
I solved the assignment using useEffect hook to make the API call. 
I have used some ternary operations and handled their values using useState.
I am afraid I have made a little bit changes to the assignment, instead of adding 'Get users' button I have directly added the onClick event to the brand logos as the 'Get user' button wasn't going with the style of the website.
I have used map function to make multiple cards , and also mapped the brand logos in navbar. 
I took one hour of time in doing this project,uploading it to github and deploying it in netlify, I got an error while I was mapping the function because usually the data stored in response is fetched by 'response.data' whereas in this case it was stored in 'response.data.data'.
I can also see that there is pagination involved in data, let me know if I have to use that.
